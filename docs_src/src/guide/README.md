# Introduction

Welcome to the Goyave documentation!  


This documentation is both a guide and a reference for Goyave application building. You will find instructions covering the basics as well as more advanced topics, from project setup to deployment. But first, let's talk about the framework itself.

Goyave is a framework aiming at **cleanliness**, **fast development** and **power**. Goyave applications stay clean and concise thanks to minimalist function calls and route handlers. The framework gives you all the tools to create an easily readable and maintainable web application, which let you concentrate on the business logic. Although Goyave handles many things for you, such as headers or marshaling, this characteristic doesn't compromise on your freedom of code.

Most golang frameworks for web development don't have a strong directory structure nor conventions to make applications have a uniform architecture and limit redundancy. This makes it difficult to work with them on different projects. In companies, having a well-defined and documented architecture helps new developers integrate projects faster, and reduces the time needed for maintaining them. For open source projects, it helps newcomers understanding the project and makes it easier to contribute.
